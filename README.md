# 🔮 Predictive Modeling

Welcome to the **Predictive Modeling** repository! This project repository showcases a variety of predictive modeling workflows using Python, covering the entire machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing to model evaluation and deployment strategies.

## 📌 Objectives

- Explore predictive modeling techniques using real-world datasets.
- Implement supervised learning algorithms like regression and classification models.
- Evaluate and fine-tune models for optimal performance.
- Demonstrate end-to-end workflows in Jupyter Notebooks.
- Share reusable code and insights for data science practitioners.

## 🛠️ Features

- 📊 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, feature engineering.
- 🤖 Model Development: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and more.
- 📈 Model Evaluation: Cross-validation, confusion matrix, ROC/AUC, RMSE, etc.
- 🧪 Experimentation: Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.
- 📁 Project Structure: Modular code for scalability and readability.
